        "text": "Startups in Armenia must comply primarily with business registration laws, licensing requirements, tax regulations, data privacy laws, and competition laws. Key regulations affecting startups include:\n\n- **Business Registration and Legal Structure:** Startups typically register as Limited Liability Companies (LLC), Closed Joint-Stock Companies (CJSC), Open Joint-Stock Companies (OJSC), or Sole Proprietors. Business registration is streamlined with a process that takes 2-3 working days, supported by digital systems[[1]](https://www.lsa.am/articles/legal-steps-to-starting-a-business-in-armenia-and-compliance-requirements-2025/)[[6]](https://mblegal.am/setting-up-an-it-company-in-armenia/).\n\n- **Licenses and Permits:** Depending on the industry, startups may need specific licenses or permits beyond company registration. For example, sectors like finance, banking, insurance, healthcare, education, food service, and mining require regulatory approval or licensing (e.g., from the Central Bank for financial startups). Using certain terms like “Armenia” or “Armenian” in the company name requires special government permission and incurs additional fees[[4]](https://armenian-lawyer.com/business-registration/common-mistakes-foreign-entrepreneurs-armenia/).\n\n- **Taxation:** Tax obligations for startups include an 18% profit tax, 20% VAT, and other property, income, and excise taxes. For tech startups, Armenia offers tax incentives such as a 1% turnover tax rate for qualifying high-tech companies starting in 2025. Additionally, there are state support measures including income tax refunds for new employees, especially for startups with up to 30 employees[[3]](https://hightech.gov.am/en/tegekatvakan-kentron/ayl/norutyunner/tax-benefits-for-tech)[[7]](https://remotepeople.com/countries/armenia/doing-business-in-armenia/)[[13]](https://profin.am/en/armenias-it-tax-policies-for-2025/)[[15]](https://armenian-lawyer.com/business-immigration/armenia-estonia-tech-startup-comparison/).\n\n- **Data Privacy and Protection:** Startups processing personal data must comply with the “Law on Personal Data Protection,” which aligns with EU GDPR standards. Compliance involves obtaining valid legal grounds for data processing, securing explicit user consent, and respecting data subject rights such as access, correction, and deletion of personal data[[2]](http://retrieve.am/data-privacy-regulations-in-armenia-navigating-compliance-in-the-tech-startup-industry/)[[10]](https://captaincompliance.com/education/armenia-data-protection-law/).\n\n- **Competition Law:** Startups must avoid anti-competitive practices prohibited under Armenia’s competition law. This includes avoiding horizontal agreements such as price-fixing, market division, bid rigging, abuse of dominant position, and unfair competition.

        "html": "<p>Startups in Armenia must comply primarily with business registration laws, licensing requirements, tax regulations, data privacy laws, and competition laws. Key regulations affecting startups include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Business Registration and Legal Structure:</strong> Startups typically register as Limited Liability Companies (LLC), Closed Joint-Stock Companies (CJSC), Open Joint-Stock Companies (OJSC), or Sole Proprietors. Business registration is streamlined with a process that takes 2-3 working days, supported by digital systems<a href=\"https://www.lsa.am/articles/legal-steps-to-starting-a-business-in-armenia-and-compliance-requirements-2025/\">[1]</a><a href=\"https://mblegal.am/setting-up-an-it-company-in-armenia/\">[6]</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Licenses and Permits:</strong> Depending on the industry, startups may need specific licenses or permits beyond company registration. For example, sectors like finance, banking, insurance, healthcare, education, food service, and mining require regulatory approval or licensing (e.g., from the Central Bank for financial startups). Using certain terms like “Armenia” or “Armenian” in the company name requires special government permission and incurs additional fees<a href=\"https://armenian-lawyer.com/business-registration/common-mistakes-foreign-entrepreneurs-armenia/\">[4]</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Taxation:</strong> Tax obligations for startups include an 18% profit tax, 20% VAT, and other property, income, and excise taxes. For tech startups, Armenia offers tax incentives such as a 1% turnover tax rate for qualifying high-tech companies starting in 2025. Additionally, there are state support measures including income tax refunds for new employees, especially for startups with up to 30 employees<a href=\"https://hightech.gov.am/en/tegekatvakan-kentron/ayl/norutyunner/tax-benefits-for-tech\">[3]</a><a href=\"https://remotepeople.com/countries/armenia/doing-business-in-armenia/\">[7]</a><a href=\"https://profin.am/en/armenias-it-tax-policies-for-2025/\">[13]</a><a href=\"https://armenian-lawyer.com/business-immigration/armenia-estonia-tech-startup-comparison/\">[15]</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Data Privacy and Protection:</strong> Startups processing personal data must comply with the “Law on Personal Data Protection,” which aligns with EU GDPR standards.
