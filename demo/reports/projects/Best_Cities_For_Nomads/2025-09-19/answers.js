      "qwen_32b": "<think>Okay, the user is asking about the best cities for nomads. I need to provide a comprehensive answer with links as per the guidelines. But wait, the user mentioned that I cannot include URLs unless they are in the prompt. Hmm, looking back, the system prompt does not have any URLs. Oh, but the guidelines required linking every product, service, etc. But now the user says NOT to include links unless from the prompt. There's a conflict here.\n\nWait the language is: \"You MUST respond in the language of the prompt. You cannot mix languages.\" But also \"cannot return any URLs/links in the answer UNLESS provided in the prompt.\" Since the user's question doesn't have any links, I cannot add any. But the initial guidelines instructed to include source links. The user's latest instruction supersedes that. So I must not include any URLs. So I have to mention cities but without links.\n\nI should proceed to list the cities, not mentioning any link sources. But the original guidelines said to link everything. However the user's instructions now prohibit adding URLs. So I have to choose. Since the user says to follow the rules, I can't add links here.\n\nLet me list the top cities for digital nomads, as per common info. Consider places known for co-working spaces, cost of living, internet, and community. Cities like Chiang Mai, Bali, Valencia, Lisbon, Medellin, Lisbon again? Maybe Prague? Also places like Port Louis in Mauritius? Or maybe Costa Rica?\n\nWait, but without links, just the cities and features. Need to structure it as a numbered list, following the rules: no double line breaks in items. Okay.\n\nSo list them with bullet points, each with reasons. Make sure to follow all the rules, especially not adding links. The user wants best cities for nomads. Need to make it clear and concise, as per their request.\n</think>\n\nHere are some top cities globally known for being highly accommodating to digital nomads:  \n\n1. **Chiang Mai (Thailand)**  \n   Renowned for affordable living, vibrant co-working spaces (e.g., Base Camp and Hubba), and a strong expat community.  \n\n2. **Bali (Indonesia)**  \n   Offers stunning scenery, numerous co-working hubs (like Bali Beach Club Workspace and Workace), and flexible remote-living options.  \n\n3. **Valencia (Spain)**  \n   Combines great weather, low costs compared to Western Europe, and modern coworking spaces like Base Val√®ncia.  \n\n4. **Lisbon (Portugal)**  \n   Provides beautiful architecture, excellent internet connectivity, and programs like the Digtal Nomad Visa (Arbitration visa for non-EU citizens).  \n\n5. **Medell√≠n (Colombia)**  \n   Known for its \"City of Eternal Spring\" climate, thriving entrepreneurship scene, and coworking spaces such as Deskpace and Bambuco.  \n\n6. **Prague (Czech Republic)**  \n   Affordable housing, fast internet, and spaces like Impact Hub Prague, while offering easy access to EU and global markets.  \n\n7. **Port Louis (Mauritius)**  \n   A newer hotspot with the Digital Nomad Visa, tropical beaches, and lower costs‚Äîideal for escaping colder climates.  \n\n8. **Costa Rica‚Äôs Pacific Coast (e.g., Manuel Antonio or Tamarindo)**  \n   Combines beach living with coworking options (e.g., TIC Space) and stable infrastructure.  \n\n9. **Goa (India)**  \n   Festive vibe, yoga retreats, and coworking spaces like Founders Collective attract creatives and entrepreneurs.  \n\n10. **Phnom Penh (Cambodia)**  \n    Rising as a budget-friendly destination with spaces like Coworking Cambodia and a growing startup ecosystem.  \n\nConsider factors like visa requirements, language barriers, and internet reliability when choosing a destination."
