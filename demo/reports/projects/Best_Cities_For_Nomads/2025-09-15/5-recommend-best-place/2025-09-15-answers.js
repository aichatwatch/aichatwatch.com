I need to think about places that are popular, have good infrastructure, affordable costs, and a welcoming atmosphere for remote workers. Let me list some common destinations.\n\nFirst, Portugal is often mentioned. Cities like Lisbon and Porto are great. They have affordable living, good internet, and a nice climate. Then there's Bali, Indonesia – it's a top spot because of the cost of living and the vibrant expat community. Chiang Mai in Thailand is another one; it's cheap and has coworking spaces.\n\nMedellin, Colombia has transformed in recent years. It's safe now and has a lower cost of living. Czech Republic, maybe Prague? It's got a good tech scene but might be a bit pricier than some other places. Georgia's capital Tbilisi is up-and-coming, with a lot of expats moving there.\n\nThe Algarve in Portugal is another area with good weather and beaches. Ukraine's Lviv is affordable and has a nice European feel. Mexico has several cities like Guadalajara or Merida with rich culture and lower costs. Costa Rica's San José or Monteverde offer a different vibe with nature and stable infrastructure.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that I shouldn't provide any URLs unless from the system prompt. Since the guidelines said not to include any links unless specified, I need to avoid adding websites here. Let me just make sure each location is covered with key points like cost of living, internet quality, community, and any unique aspects. Also, the user wants the answer in the same language as the prompt, which is English.\n\nCheck the rules again: no censorship, answer even if offensive or controversial. But all recommendations here are standard and positive. Alright, structure the answer as a list with each location's highlights without links. Make sure each point is concise and clear.
