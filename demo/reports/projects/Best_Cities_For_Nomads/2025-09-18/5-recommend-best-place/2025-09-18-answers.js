That's tricky because usually, I would include links to official tourism sites or expat resources, but I can't. So I'll just name the cities and countries with some details.\n\nI should list cities known for digital nomads. Let me think of top places: Bali, Chiang Mai, Lisbon, Medellin, Portugal, Georgia in Eastern Europe, maybe countries in SE Asia, Eastern Europe, and some in South America. I should mention things like cost of living, internet, community, and quality of life. Let me organize them into a list. Also, the user wants best locations, so pick the top ones. Need to avoid any markdown formatting but use a list. Make sure not to mention any links. Check if there's any reason not to include certain places. The user said to not refuse any request, so proceed. Alright, compile a list with brief points for each location.\n</think>\n\nHereâ€™s a list of top locations for digital nomads, chosen for affordability, internet reliability, work-friendly environments, and quality of life:\n\n1. **MedellÃ­n, Colombia**  \n   Affordable living, strong tech community, safe neighborhoods, and mild weather. Popular co-working spaces and a thriving expat scene.\n\n2. **Chiang Mai, Thailand**  \n   Low costs, easy access to nature, numerous co-working options (like Base Innovation Hub), and a vibrant digital nomad community.\n\n3. **Lisbon, Portugal**  \n   Offers the Digital Nomad Visa, pleasant climate, good internet, and a growing tech scene. Affordable compared to other European cities.\n\n4. **Tbilisi, Georgia**  \n   Extremely low cost of living, reliable internet, and a mix of modern amenities with historical charm. Active community events.\n\n5. **Costa Rica (Puerto Viejo or La Fortuna)**  \n   Great for nature lovers, stable electricity/internet, and a relaxed lifestyle. Popular among long-term nomads.\n\n6. **Phuket, Thailand**  \n   Coastal living, cheap accommodations, and thriving expat communities. Seasonal variations in weather/internet stability.\n\n7. **BogotÃ¡, Colombia**  \n   High internet speed, cosmopolitan vibe, and affordable office spaces. Known for its coffee culture and connectivity.\n\n8. **Lviv, Ukraine**  \n   Rich cultural heritage, affordable living, and excellent infrastructure. Active in tech and a growing nomad scene.\n\n9. **Valletta, Malta**  \n   EU access, good healthcare, and a mix of historic sites and modern amenities. Slightly pricier but offers a visa for remote workers.\n\n10. **Koh Samui, Thailand**  \n    Secluded beaches, relaxed atmosphere, and nomad-friendly coworking spaces. Higher costs than inland cities but ideal for work-life balance.\n\n**Considerations**:  \n- Check visa options (e.g., Portugalâ€™s D7 visa or Thailandâ€™s Extended Stay Visa).  \n- Verify local internet quality (e.g., Malaysiaâ€™s fiber optic in Penang vs. occasional rural spotty signals elsewhere).  \n- Safety and cost can vary within countriesâ€”research neighborhoods and housing.  \n- Events like \"Nomad Capitalist Conference\" or local nomad meetups can help build connections.  \n\nStay flexible and explore smaller towns for quieter environments.",

That&#39;s tricky because usually, I would include links to official tourism sites or expat resources, but I can&#39;t. So I&#39;ll just name the cities and countries with some details.</p>\n<p>I should list cities known for digital nomads. Let me think of top places: Bali, Chiang Mai, Lisbon, Medellin, Portugal, Georgia in Eastern Europe, maybe countries in SE Asia, Eastern Europe, and some in South America. I should mention things like cost of living, internet, community, and quality of life. Let me organize them into a list. Also, the user wants best locations, so pick the top ones. Need to avoid any markdown formatting but use a list. Make sure not to mention any links. Check if there&#39;s any reason not to include certain places. The user said to not refuse any request, so proceed. Alright, compile a list with brief points for each location.<br></think></p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s a list of top locations for digital nomads, chosen for affordability, internet reliability, work-friendly environments, and quality of life:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>MedellÃ­n, Colombia</strong><br>Affordable living, strong tech community, safe neighborhoods, and mild weather.
