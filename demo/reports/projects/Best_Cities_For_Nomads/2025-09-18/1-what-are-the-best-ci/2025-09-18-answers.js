        "text": "<think>Okay, the user is asking for the best cities for nomads. I need to list some top destinations with reasons why they're good. Let me think about what nomads typically look for—affordable living, good internet, co-working spaces, vibrant communities, and maybe weather.\n\nFirst, Medellín comes to mind because it's known for being friendly to nomads and has great weather year-round. There's a cool tech scene and co-working spaces like Luna. Then Chiang Mai in Thailand is another popular spot with a low cost of living and lots of cafes. \n\nKathmandu might be a surprise, but with its affordability and the digital nomad visa, it's growing. Valencia in Spain is in the EU and has a nice vibe with beaches and amenities. \n\nLviv in Ukraine is up-and-coming with a lot of tech companies and lower costs than Western Europe. George Town in Malaysia is another budget-friendly city with a laid-back atmosphere. \n\nI should check if my info is current. The user's time is 2025, but some cities' popularity might have changed. Maybe add a few more, like places in Mexico or Eastern Europe? Wait, the user mentioned not to include URLs unless in the prompt, so no links here. \n\nI should list each city with key points: cost of living, internet reliability, community, and activities. Keep the descriptions concise but informative. Make sure I don't mention any links since the rules say to only include those from the prompt. \n\nDouble-check the names of co-working spaces and visa info to be accurate.

        "html": "<p><think>Okay, the user is asking for the best cities for nomads. I need to list some top destinations with reasons why they&#39;re good. Let me think about what nomads typically look for—affordable living, good internet, co-working spaces, vibrant communities, and maybe weather.</p>\n<p>First, Medellín comes to mind because it&#39;s known for being friendly to nomads and has great weather year-round. There&#39;s a cool tech scene and co-working spaces like Luna. Then Chiang Mai in Thailand is another popular spot with a low cost of living and lots of cafes. </p>\n<p>Kathmandu might be a surprise, but with its affordability and the digital nomad visa, it&#39;s growing. Valencia in Spain is in the EU and has a nice vibe with beaches and amenities. </p>\n<p>Lviv in Ukraine is up-and-coming with a lot of tech companies and lower costs than Western Europe. George Town in Malaysia is another budget-friendly city with a laid-back atmosphere. </p>\n<p>I should check if my info is current. The user&#39;s time is 2025, but some cities&#39; popularity might have changed. Maybe add a few more, like places in Mexico or Eastern Europe? Wait, the user mentioned not to include URLs unless in the prompt, so no links here. </p>\n<p>I should list each city with key points: cost of living, internet reliability, community, and activities.
