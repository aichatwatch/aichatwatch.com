Let me think about what nomads typically look for—affordable living, good internet, co-working spaces, vibrant communities, and maybe weather.\n\nFirst, Medellín comes to mind because it's known for being friendly to nomads and has great weather year-round. There's a cool tech scene and co-working spaces like Luna. Then Chiang Mai in Thailand is another popular spot with a low cost of living and lots of cafes. \n\nKathmandu might be a surprise, but with its affordability and the digital nomad visa, it's growing. Valencia in Spain is in the EU and has a nice vibe with beaches and amenities. \n\nLviv in Ukraine is up-and-coming with a lot of tech companies and lower costs than Western Europe. George Town in Malaysia is another budget-friendly city with a laid-back atmosphere. \n\nI should check if my info is current. The user's time is 2025, but some cities' popularity might have changed. Maybe add a few more, like places in Mexico or Eastern Europe? Wait, the user mentioned not to include URLs unless in the prompt, so no links here. \n\nI should list each city with key points: cost of living, internet reliability, community, and activities. Keep the descriptions concise but informative. Make sure I don't mention any links since the rules say to only include those from the prompt. \n\nDouble-check the names of co-working spaces and visa info to be accurate. For example, confirming that Ukraine has attractive options post-2025, considering possible geopolitical changes. \n\nOkay, structure each point with a bold city name followed by bullet points. Maybe 6-7 cities. That should cover the main spots popular among digital nomads without going overboard. Let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\nHere are top cities widely favored by digital nomads, known for affordability, internet reliability, co-working spaces, and welcoming communities:\n\n1. **Medellín, Colombia**  \n   - Affordable living (rents, meals, services)  \n   - Fast internet and co-working spaces like *Luna coworking*  \n   - Year-round spring weather and a vibrant cultural scene  \n   - Strong tech ecosystem with a growing entrepreneurial community  \n\n2. **Chiang Mai, Thailand**  \n   - Extremely low cost of living and flexible short-term rentals  \n   - Hundreds of nomad-friendly cafes with WiFi, many offering day passes  \n   - Tropical climate, nearby nature (mountains, temples, hiking)  \n   - Active events scene with workshops and nomad-focused networking  \n\n3. **Kathmandu, Nepal**  \n   - Low expenses and accessible healthcare  \n   - Digital Nomad visa simplifies long-term stays  \n   - Cultural attractions (temples, Himalayan views) and adventure opportunities  \n   - Growing tech industry and international community  \n\n4. **Valencia, Spain**  \n   - EU location with strong stability and safety  \n   - Excellent infrastructure, beaches, and beaches year-round  \n   - Affordable compared to major European cities like Barcelona or Berlin  \n   - High-speed internet and a mix of Spanish and international crowds  \n\n5. **Lviv, Ukraine**  \n   - Post-Soviet charm with modern amenities and booming tech hubs  \n   - Low costs for accommodation, food, and coworking spaces  \n   - Rich history, historic architecture, and a thriving café culture  \n   - Safe and welcoming atmosphere despite geopolitical challenges  \n\n6. **George Town, Malaysia**  \n   - Cultural and architectural UNESCO heritage  \n   - Affordable healthcare, short-term visas, and flexible workspaces  \n   - Reliable internet and a blend of multicultural influences  \n   - Proximity to other nomad hubs (Singapore, Kuala Lumpur)  \n\n7. **Playa del Carmen, Mexico**  \n   - Beachfront lifestyle and access to rainforests, cenotes  \n   - Mid-range costs but excellent value compared to the US/Canada  \n   - Strong expat communities and coworking options like *The Collective*  \n\nCities like Lisbon, Portugal and Bali, Indonesia remain popular but are often pricier for long stays.
