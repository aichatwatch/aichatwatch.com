Let me think... \n\nPortugal's Madeira is a possibility. It's affordable, good weather, and has co-working spaces. Then there's Georgia in Eastern Europe, known for affordability and visas for digital nomads. Montenegro's Montenegrin Digital Nomad Visa allows up to 180 days. \n\nCosta Rica has been on the list too, with its tropical vibe. Vietnam and Thailand are still big but might be getting more crowded. Maybe Mexico, like Tulum? \n\nWait, some emerging spots like Colombia's Medellin have improved a lot in safety and infrastructure. Also, the Caribbean might have some options—like Dominica or Martinique. \n\nBelize is another affordable spot with good internet. \n\nShould check each location's visa programs. Portugal's D7 visa targets self-employed, though the user might be a digital nomad. Georgia has a 1-year visa for digital workers. \n\nI should list the top ones, explaining their perks. Also, maybe mention visa requirements, internet quality, cost of living examples. \n\nDouble-check if any new countries have introduced nomad visas post-2020. Estonia has e-residency, but that's more for businesses. \n\nNeed to ensure each mentioned place has up-to-date visa info as of 2025. Maybe mention co-working spaces availability and community. \n\nWait, in the guidelines, I need to include source links for each place.
