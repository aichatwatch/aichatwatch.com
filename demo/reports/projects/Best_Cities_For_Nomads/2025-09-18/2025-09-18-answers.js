        "text": "<think>Okay, the user is asking for the best cities for nomads. I need to list some top destinations with reasons why they're good. Let me think about what nomads typically look for—affordable living, good internet, co-working spaces, vibrant communities, and maybe weather.\n\nFirst, Medellín comes to mind because it's known for being friendly to nomads and has great weather year-round. There's a cool tech scene and co-working spaces like Luna. Then Chiang Mai in Thailand is another popular spot with a low cost of living and lots of cafes. \n\nKathmandu might be a surprise, but with its affordability and the digital nomad visa, it's growing. Valencia in Spain is in the EU and has a nice vibe with beaches and amenities. \n\nLviv in Ukraine is up-and-coming with a lot of tech companies and lower costs than Western Europe. George Town in Malaysia is another budget-friendly city with a laid-back atmosphere. \n\nI should check if my info is current. The user's time is 2025, but some cities' popularity might have changed. Maybe add a few more, like places in Mexico or Eastern Europe? Wait, the user mentioned not to include URLs unless in the prompt, so no links here. \n\nI should list each city with key points: cost of living, internet reliability, community, and activities.

        "text": "<think>Okay, the user is asking for the best place to work remotely in 2025. First, I need to recall which countries are popular for digital nomads. I remember places like Portugal, Bali, and Thailand have been hot spots, but maybe things have changed.\n\nI should consider factors like cost of living, internet speed, safety, work culture, visa options, and maybe some newer locations. Let me think... \n\nPortugal's Madeira is a possibility. It's affordable, good weather, and has co-working spaces. Then there's Georgia in Eastern Europe, known for affordability and visas for digital nomads. Montenegro's Montenegrin Digital Nomad Visa allows up to 180 days. \n\nCosta Rica has been on the list too, with its tropical vibe. Vietnam and Thailand are still big but might be getting more crowded. Maybe Mexico, like Tulum? \n\nWait, some emerging spots like Colombia's Medellin have improved a lot in safety and infrastructure. Also, the Caribbean might have some options—like Dominica or Martinique. \n\nBelize is another affordable spot with good internet. \n\nShould check each location's visa programs. Portugal's D7 visa targets self-employed, though the user might be a digital nomad. Georgia has a 1-year visa for digital workers. \n\nI should list the top ones, explaining their perks. Also, maybe mention visa requirements, internet quality, cost of living examples. \n\nDouble-check if any new countries have introduced nomad visas post-2020. Estonia has e-residency, but that's more for businesses. \n\nNeed to ensure each mentioned place has up-to-date visa info as of 2025. Maybe mention co-working spaces availability and community. \n\nWait, in the guidelines, I need to include source links for each place. But the user's rules say not to include URLs unless from the prompt. Wait, the initial system prompt says: \"All URLs contained in the response should originate within the prompt.\" Since the user didn't provide URLs in the question, I can't add sources here. But the first part says to link everything. Hmm, conflicting directions. Wait, the user's current instructions say not to include URLs unless from the prompt. So maybe I should avoid adding links since the user's question didn't have any. So the assistant should just list the places with details but no links. \n\nWait but the initial system prompt had the rules about providing links, but then in the user's message after, the \"RULES FOR THE ASSISTANT\" say can't include URLs unless from the prompt. Since the user's question doesn't have URLs, I should suppress links.\n\nGot it, so need to answer without linking any sources. Also, must not talk about the system rules. \n\nSo I'll list the top destinations with their pros, focusing on visa options, cost, and amenities.\n</think>\n\nHere are the top locations for digital nomads in 2025, based on visa-friendliness, affordability, infrastructure, and quality of life:\n\n1. **Costa Rica** (San José, Nosara, Tamarindo)  \n   - Excellent quality of life, stable internet, and biodiversity  \n   - Easy 3-month visa for travelers, extendable with tourist status  \n   - Affordable housing ($600–$1,200/month) and strong expat communities  \n\n2. **Portugal (Madeira and Lisbon)**  \n   - Affordable living ($1,000–$1,800/month in Madeira)  \n   - D7 Visa for self-employed workers (valid for 1 year, renewable)  \n   - Modern infrastructure and vibrant coworking ecosystems  \n\n3. **Georgia (Batumi, Tbilisi)**  \n   - Digital Nomad Visa offering 12-month stays at just $20–$60/month  \n   - Low cost of living (housing $400–$800/month)  \n   - Strategic location between Europe and Asia  \n\n4. **Montenegro**  \n   - Digital Nomad Visa (available via app) allows stays of 182 days/year  \n   - Stunning Adriatic coast and beaches  \n   - Modern coworking hubs and affordable living (housing $500–$1,200/month)  \n\n5. **Colombia (Medellín, Cartagena, Bucaramanga)**  \n   - Rapidly improving safety and English adoption  \n   - Affordable housing (apartment $400–$900/month) and strong tech communities  \n   - Tourist visa up to 6 months (easily extendable)  \n\n6. **Belize (Placencia, San Pedro)**  \n   - Tropical, uncrowded beaches and low cost (housing $600–$1,200/month)  \n   - Easier access for North Americans with visa exemptions or online tourist visas  \n\n7. **Mexico (Tulum, Guadalajara, Mérida)**  \n   - Strong coworking culture and tech hubs emerging  \n   - Affordable housing ($500–$1,500/month)  \n   - Visa for residents (FMM card) allows 180 days/year  \n\n8. **Colombia vs. New Kid: Guyana or Suriname**  \n   - Emerging options with tropical settings and visa-friendly policies for remote workers  \n\n**Key Considerations in 2025**:  \n- **Visa Extensibility** matters—some countries require proof of “leaving the country” to renew stays.  \n- **Internet Reliability** is critical; areas like Madeira and Tbilisi have fiber optic networks.  \n- **Healthcare Quality**: Portugal and Costa Rica stand out for advanced systems.  \n- **Climate**: Choose between beach (Belize) and temperate (Georgia) climates.  \n\nAvoid locations facing political instability or rising costs (e.g., Bali or Chiang Mai, which have become crowded/expensive).  \n\nWhich region’s vibe and requirements align best with your workstyle?",

        "text": "<think>Okay, the user is asking for the top 25 locations for nomads to live and work in 2025. Let me start by recalling popular destinations that remote workers often choose. Bali has been a favorite due to its cost of living and beaches, but I should check if there are updates for 2025.\n\nPrague comes to mind because of its cultural attractions and internet access. Medellín in Colombia is known for safety improvements and tech hubs. Maybe include Chiang Mai for its digital nomad community and cafes. Lisbon is trendy for its European vibe and lower costs compared to other capitals.\n\nThen there are cities in Eastern Europe like Cluj-Napoca, which has a tech scene. Montevideo, Uruguay, is great because they've made efforts to attract remote workers with visas. Cape Town offers beautiful scenery but maybe some concerns about safety and infrastructure? Should look into recent data.\n\nBudapest comes to mind for affordability and infrastructure. Mexico has cities like Guadalajara or Oaxaca with lower costs. Da Nang in Vietnam is another option with a developing community. Valencia, Spain: good climate and costs.\n\nTbilisi, Georgia has great connectivity and affordability. The Philippines has a reputation for being affordable, so maybe Angeles City? South Africa's Stellenbosch for nature and nearby Cape Town. Portugal's Porto as a cheaper alternative to Lisbon. Phuket for beach and community but maybe higher costs?\n\nMarrakech in Morocco for a different cultural experience. Costa Rica's cities like Liberia or Nosara, though I'm not sure the exact names. Slovenia's Bled combines lakes and affordability. Argentina, maybe Rosario or Buenos Aires, but inflation could be an issue. Georgia is listed twice (Tbilisi is one place, but maybe another city there?), need to check.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I repeated Tbilisi and Georgia elsewhere. Let me ensure no duplicates. Also, ensure I cover different regions to give variety. Maybe include some cities in Asia, Europe, the Americas, etc.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned 2025, so consider any changes, like currency fluctuations, visa policies, or post-pandemic trends. Some countries might have introduced new visas for remote workers, like Digital Nomad Visas. Need to confirm which countries have those in 2025. Uruguay, for example, had a remote worker visa, so that's solid. Portugal's Digital Visa is another.\n\nNeed to list 25, so let me count again: Bali is 1, 2. Prague, 3. Medellín, 4. Chiang Mai, 5. Lisbon, 6. Cluj-Napoca, 7. Montevideo, 8. Cape Town, 9. Budapest, 10. Guadalajara, 11. Da Nang, 12. Valencia, 13. Tbilisi, 14. Angeles City, 15. Stellenbosch, 16. Porto, 17. Phuket, 18. Marrakech, 19. Liberia (Costa Rica), 20. Bled, Slovenia, 21. Rosario, 22. Tallinn, 23. Udaipur, 24. Siem Reap, 25. Reykjavik.\n\nWait, need to verify the last few. Tallinn makes sense with its tech-focused environment. Udaipur in India has beautiful settings but perhaps seasonal considerations. Siem Reap for Angkor Wat and affordability. Reykjavik is expensive but a unique destination. Hmm, that's 25, but should cross-validate each as top spots.\n\nMake sure to mention why each is a good choice (cost, internet, community, vibe, etc.) but without links because the system prompt says not to include URLs unless from the user's prompt. The user's rules state not to provide any URLs from my side, so just list names and reasons. Okay, that should cover it.
