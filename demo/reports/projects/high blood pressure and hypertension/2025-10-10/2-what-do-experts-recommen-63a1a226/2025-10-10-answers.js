It emphasizes:\n- Fruits and vegetables\n- Whole grains\n- Lean proteins\n- Low-fat dairy\n- Limited sodium (ideally less than 2,300 mg/day, or 1,500 mg for greater effect)\n\n### 2. **Regular Physical Activity**\nThe [American Heart Association (AHA)](https://www.heart.org/) recommends:\n- At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week\n- Or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise\n- Muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days per week\n\n### 3. **Weight Management**\nAccording to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/), losing even 5-10 pounds can help reduce blood pressure if you're overweight.\n\n### 4. **Limit Alcohol**\n- Men: No more than 2 drinks per day\n- Women: No more than 1 drink per day\n(Source: [AHA Guidelines](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure))\n\n### 5. **Reduce Sodium Intake**\nThe [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/) and medical experts recommend limiting sodium to reduce blood pressure effectively.\n\n## Medical Management\n\n### 1. **Regular Monitoring**\n- Home blood pressure monitors recommended by the [American Medical Association (AMA)](https://www.ama-assn.org/)\n- Regular check-ups with healthcare providers\n\n### 2. **Medications (When Needed)**\nAccording to [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373417), common medications include:\n- **ACE inhibitors**\n- **ARBs (Angiotensin II receptor blockers)**\n- **Calcium channel blockers**\n- **Diuretics**\n- **Beta-blockers**\n\nThe choice depends on individual factors and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.\n\n## Stress Management\n\n### Recommended Techniques:\n- Meditation and mindfulness\n- Deep breathing exercises\n- Yoga\n- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night)\n\nThe [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://www.apa.org/) discusses the connection between stress and hypertension.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- **[National Institute of Health (NIH) - High Blood Pressure](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/high-blood-pressure)**: Comprehensive information on hypertension\n- **[World Health Organization (WHO) - Hypertension](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension)**: Global perspective and guidelines\n- **[Johns Hopkins Medicine - High Blood Pressure](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/high-blood-pressure-hypertension)**: Expert medical information\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: Always work with your doctor before making significant changes to diet, exercise, or medication\n2. **Individual Variation**: What works best varies by person, age, and other health conditions\n3. **Consistency is Key**: Blood pressure management is typically a long-term commitment\n\nAccording to the [2017 ACC/AHA Guidelines](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2017/11/09/11/41/2017-guideline-for-high-blood-pressure-in-adults), normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mmHg, and hypertension is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher.",
