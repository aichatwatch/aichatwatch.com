        "text": "## Tracking AI Chatbot Responses Across Platforms\n\nTo track how AI chatbots—such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing AI, Gemini, and more—respond to specific topics or queries about your brand, product, or yourself across platforms, you need a strategy that covers both monitoring and analytics. Here are the main approaches, with linked sources for each tool or service:\n\n### For Monitoring Responses to Brands, People, and Products\n\n**Track AI Answers** is a dedicated platform that aggregates what various AI chatbots and large language models (LLMs)—including ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing AI, Google Bard, and others—say about a person, brand, or product. It lets you search once and see results from multiple AI systems on a single page, and you can sign up for notifications if those answers change. This is particularly valuable for reputation management and brand monitoring in an era where consumers increasingly rely on AI-generated answers instead of traditional search engines[[2]](https://trackaianswers.com).  \n[Track AI Answers](https://trackaianswers.com)\n\n**SE Ranking’s AI Traffic Analytics** provides another angle, focusing on how often your website appears in AI chatbot responses (like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude) and the traffic those mentions drive to your site. It also lets you analyze session quality, compare traffic across AI sources, and benchmark your visibility against competitors in AI-generated answers[[4]](https://seranking.com/ai-traffic-analytics.html).  \n[SE Ranking AI Traffic Analytics](https://seranking.com/ai-traffic-analytics.html)\n\n### For Tracking Chatbot Performance and User Interactions\n\nIf you run your own chatbot (e.g., a Drift, Botpress, or IBM Watson Assistant bot), you can use built-in or third-party analytics tools to monitor engagement, user queries, sentiment, and more. These tools typically provide dashboards, real-time reporting, and insights into how users interact with your bot, but they are designed for tracking the performance of a single bot, not for cross-platform monitoring of major public AI chatbots like ChatGPT:\n\n- **Drift Analytics**: Tracks chatbot performance, user behavior, and drop-off rates for Drift chatbots, with a real-time dashboard[[1]](https://woosellservices.com/best-ai-chatbot-traffic-analytics-tools/).  \n  [Drift](https://www.drift.com)\n- **Botpress Analytics**: Open-source analytics for Botpress chatbots, customizable for in-depth reporting on user interactions and sentiment analysis[[1]](https://woosellservices.com/best-ai-chatbot-traffic-analytics-tools/).  \n  [Botpress](https://botpress.com)\n- **Chatbase**: Google’s chatbot analytics, optimized for monitoring performance and improving conversation flows in your own chatbots[[1]](https://woosellservices.com/best-ai-chatbot-traffic-analytics-tools/).  \n  [Chatbase](https://chatbase.com)\n- **Dashbot**: Offers KPI tracking, conversation history, and user flow analysis for chatbots on multiple platforms[[3]](https://masterofcode.com/blog/top-chatbot-analytics-tools).  \n  [Dashbot](https://www.dashbot.io)\n- **BotMetrics**: Free analytics for Facebook Messenger bots, tracking user engagement and conversation history[[3]](https://masterofcode.com/blog/top-chatbot-analytics-tools).  \n  [BotMetrics](https://www.getbotmetrics.com)\n\n### For Monitoring Individual Device and App Usage\n\nIf your goal is to track how a specific person interacts with AI chatbots on their device (e.g., for parental controls or compliance), you can use monitoring apps like **mSpy**. These apps can record chat histories, timestamps, and sometimes even deleted messages for chatbot activity within supported apps. However, for web-based AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT in a browser), tracking is more limited and typically involves logging web activity or keystrokes rather than full conversation transcripts.
